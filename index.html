        <p align="justify">I am a Licensed Electronics Engineer and Technician, enthusiastic in learning new things and adapting to different environments. Not bounded by any fear of incompetence but always open in seeking growth, eager to evolve regardless of the changing times. 
          Despite having a sudden shift in career, through my 7 months of working experience as a Data Acquisitions Specialist, I have greatly enjoyed supporting clients in their day-to-day tasks, specifically in Real Estate, despite being geographically bounded. I realized that through a great company, I could still be of good support to my Employer/s and client/s in the confines of my home benefiting both parties; being more productive and effective, given the advantage of staying at home with my loved ones and my dog. 
          As someone who is always seeking growth and advancement not just in my career, but specifically in my values and work ethics, I am confident of my ability to learn quickly, effectively and most of all, enjoyably - almost anyone can work fast and efficient, but not everyone can do it filled with joy and positivity.
